<H2>Description</H2>
    <p>
        Nothing is more satisfying than cooking up a batch of wings without deep frying. 
        These extra crispy wings only need a light coating of cooking spray on the air 
        fryer basket. Then the magic happens: the air fryer’s fan and heating mechanism 
        create a frenzy of forceful hot air that swirls down and around the wings, 
        crisping up the skin to golden perfection (and without the added calories of 
        frying oil). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Self-contained air fryers are not the only option for cooking at home: 
        look for multi-cookers and ovens that have an air fryer setting. You can buy chicken 
        wings that are already split or do the work yourself with whole wings. Don’t forget 
        to save the tips for making chicken stock.

    <H2>Ingredients</H2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nonstick cooking spray, for the basket</li>
            <li>2 pounds chicken wings, split at the joint and tips removed </li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
            <li>1/2 cup hot sauce, such as Frank's RedHot </li>
            <li>Ranch or blue cheese dressing, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Spray the basket of a 3.5-quart air fryer with cooking spray and set aside. 
            Pat the chicken wings dry and sprinkle generously with salt. Place the wings 
            in the fryer basket so they are not touching (if necessary to fit, line up the 
            drumettes standing upright along the sides). Set the air fryer to 360 
            degrees F and cook for 12 minutes, then flip the wings with tongs and cook 
            for 12 minutes more. Flip the wings again, increase the heat to 390 degrees F 
            and cook until the outsides are extra-crispy, about 6 minutes more.

            Meanwhile, warm the butter in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until 
            melted, about 1 minute. Whisk in the hot sauce.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss the wings with the butter mixture to coat in a large bowl and serve 
            with dressing on the side.
        </li>
        


    </ul>
