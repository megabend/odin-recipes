<H2>Description</H2>
    <p>
        Quick, easy breakfast standard that will never disappoint.  
        What makes this version unique is the bit of crunchiness 
        added by the ramen noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
        The added flavor pack from the ramen also adds additional
        tastiness that is beyond your standard traditional omelet.
